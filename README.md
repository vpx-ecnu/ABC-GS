This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"ABC-GS: Alignment-Based Controllable Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splatting"**, introducing a novel approach for style transfer in 3D scenes represented by Gaussian Splatting.

## Key Features

- üé® **Multi Style Transfer Loss**: Supports four distinct style loss formulations (FAST, NNFM, KNN-FM, Gram Matrix)
- üåü **Three-Phase Training**: Pre-processing ‚Üí Style Transfer ‚Üí Post-processing pipeline
- üîç **Controllable Style Transfer**: Implements senmatic-aware and multi-style for Gaussian scene stylization
- üì¶ **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design for custom loss functions and training phases

## Installation

### Requirements 
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.8
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.3.0

### Conda

```bash
# Clone repository with submodules
git clone https://github.com/vpx-ecnu/ABC-GS --recursive
cd ABC-GS

# Install Python dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ABC-GS
pip install abcgs/submodules/lang-segment-anything
pip install gs/submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
pip install gs/submodules/simple-knn
```



## Quick Start
### Dataset and Checkpoint
* For scene dataset, you can LLFF dataset in [NeRF](https://github.com/bmild/nerf) and T&T dataset in [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). 
* For style dataset, you can find it in [ARF](https://github.com/Kai-46/ARF-svox2).
* **For optimal stylization results, ensure that the original scene is trained using 0th-order spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients.** Higher-order SH coefficients may introduce artifacts or inconsistencies during the style transfer process. Using 0th-order SH coefficients ensures smoother and more coherent stylization.

### Single Style Transfer
```
python style_transfer.py --config configs/llff_single.yaml
```
### Semantic-aware Style Transfer
```
python style_transfer.py --config configs/llff_semantic.yaml
```
### Compositional Style Transfer
```
python style_transfer.py --config configs/llff_multi.yaml
```

Please check `python style_transfer.py --help` or files under `configs/` for help.
